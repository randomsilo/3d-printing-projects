### Flash Light Mount
---

_Flash Light Mount_ is MLOK'ed to the side rail of your weapon.
Zip strips are used to secure the flash light on to the mount.
The beauty of this design is that it allows for any box store bought light to be used as a weapon mounted light.
Try to get flash lights with at least 1000 lumens and rear button for easy use.

Some tactical lights are hundreds of dollars which is fine when outfitting a single weapon.  It gets really expensive when you have handful.
